<h3>1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h3>
<ul align="left">
  <li><b>var</b>: Can be declared without an initial value,can be reassigned,function scoped</li>
  <li><b>let</b>: Can be declared without an initial value,can be reassigned,block scoped</li>
  <li><b>const</b>: Must be initialized,cannot be reassigned,block scoped</li>
</ul>

<h3>2 What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?)</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li><b>map()</b>:	To transform every element in an array and create a new array with the results.	The returned array will always have the same number of elements as the original array.</li>
<li><b>forEach()</b>:To execute a function for each element in an array, primarily for "side effects," such as logging data or updating state.Does not return an array.</li>
<li><b>filter()</b>:To select elements that pass a certain test or condition and return a new array containing only those elements.The returned array will have a length less than or equal to the original array.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) What are arrow functions in ES6?</h3>
<ul align="left">
<li> Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions introduced in ES6. </li>
<li>They use the `=>` (arrow) syntax.</li>
<li>Commonly used for concise callbacks or inline functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Destructuring assignment in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a powerful feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to distinct variables in a concise and readable way.</li></ul>

<h3>5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Template literals are a new way to create strings in ES6 using backticks (`` ` ``). They allow embedding variables and expressions directly inside the string using `${ }`.</li>
  <li>They support **multi-line strings** without needing `\n`.Easier to read and write compared to `+` concatenation.</li>
</ul>
